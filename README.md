# Car Configurator
Learned knowledge from this oop class has massively built up my capability in developing this project. i have significantly gained insight into how business problems can be solved with oop. until recently, i visited the motorshow and found that salespeople had lost many customers, as they could not close the deal within reasonable time frame and aren’t able to complete the booking transactions fast enough. thus this project was initiated to automate the critical moment of the close-sales process. through the development process, i felt determined to make it happen, since this project was the product that combined both what i learned from throughout the course and my inspiration about automobile in which i think it was great to do it.
